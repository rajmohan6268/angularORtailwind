# Angular Tailwind Starter

This is a starter repo for Angular projects that wish to use Tailwindcss with Purgecss. This reduces the amount of boilerplate and Googling to get everything working together.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/wbroberts/angular-tailwind-starter.git
cd angular-tailwind-starter
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command will build the tailwind style sheet and then will run `ng serve -o`.

## Building

`npm run build`

Building the application will generate all of the Tailwind classes and then all of the unused classes will be removed by Purgecss. After the css has been handled the application will be built and output in dist/< application name >.

## Tailwindcss

`npm run tailwind`

Tailwind builds a styles.tailwind.css file in the src/ directory (the compiled file is ignored). The generated css is huge, so when the application is built all of the unused css is purged.

## Purgecss

`npm run purge`

Purge css is ran when the application gets built. The default runs on the compiled code that is generated by Tailwind (styles.tailwind.css). All other css files are ignored.

## Prettier with Husky

There is a prettier pre-commit hook that is hooked up by default. To turn it off just erase the Husky part of the package.json. To adjust the prettier config just make changes to the .prettierrc file.
